## ðŸŽ¬ Demo
A demo video showing the CI/CD pipeline in action can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/o9P5qbeUAiY


## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** for a Java application. It integrates **code quality analysis**, **automated testing**, and **artifact management**, enabling seamless development-to-deployment workflow.

The pipeline ensures **fast, reliable, and error-free releases** while providing visibility into code quality and build status.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Features
- **Automated Builds:** Jenkins pipeline triggers builds automatically on every GitHub push.
- **Code Quality Analysis:** SonarQube integration continuously monitors and reports code quality.
- **Testing:** Maven executes unit tests, ensuring code correctness with every build.
- **Artifact Management:** Compiled JARs are deployed to Nexus Repository Manager.
- **Secure & Scalable:** Role-based access control for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Achievements & Impact
- **100% automated workflow**, eliminating manual build and deployment steps.
- **Reduced release cycle** from 2 hours to ~10 minutes.
- **Proactive bug detection** via SonarQube, preventing critical issues before deployment.
- Demonstrates **full-stack DevOps capability**: build, test, code quality, and artifact management.
